### 6. How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?
TypeScript is a simple JavaScript superset to strictly enforces the types of any variable or value. Using TypeScript, code can be written in a clear and readable format. Type-related bugs can be found during development time instead of at runtime.

### 1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
The main difference between interfaces and types is that interfaces are mainly used to define an object's type, whereas types are used to define other variables' types. One more big difference is that interfaces can be merged with another, and types can't.
