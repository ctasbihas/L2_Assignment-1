### 1. What are some differences between interfaces and types in TypeScript?
The main difference between interfaces and types is that interfaces are mainly used to define an object's type, whereas types are used to define other variables' types. One more big difference is that interfaces can be merged with another, and types can't. If you declare the same-named interface again, TypeScript will combine them, whereas types do not support merging. So, interfaces are good for objects, and types are good when you need more options.


### 6. How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?
TypeScript is a simple JavaScript superset to strictly enforces the types of any variable or value. Using TypeScript, code can be written in a clear and readable format. Type-related bugs can be found during development time instead of at runtime. TypeScript also makes the code easy to read and understand. When working in a team, everyone knows what kind of data is used. It also helps when updating or changing the code later. So, TypeScript makes projects better and easier to maintain.
